### README.md for python folder

I am going to be doing some work on the Python libraries needed for running Python programs
stand-alone outside the Elan IDE.
Rather than clutter up the development repository, I'm putting my notes here.
Feel free to add your own files, or make additions to my files -- it's not my exclusive area.
